In graph theory, the degree of a node is the number of edges coming 
into it or going out of it - how connected it is. 
For this challenge you'll be calculating the degree of every node.

Input Description:

First you'll be given an integer, N, on one line showing you how many 
nodes to account for. Next you'll be given an undirected graph as a 
series of number pairs, a and b, showing that those two nodes 
are connected - an edge. 

Example:

3 
1 2
1 3

Output Example:

Node 1 has a degree of 2
Node 2 has a degree of 1
Node 3 has a degree of 1

Bonus:

Display an adjacency matrix for the input nodes formatted as follows:

0 1 1
1 0 0
1 0 0
